- Secure File Sharing System
A secure file-sharing backend system built with FastAPI and SQLite, designed to allow two different types of users — Operation Users and Client Users — to manage file uploads and secure downloads through encrypted URLs.

- Project Overview
This system provides a REST API to enable:
* Operation Users (Ops Users) to:
    * Log in to the system
    * Upload files (only .pptx, .docx, .xlsx)
* Client Users to:
    * Sign up (receive an encrypted URL)
    * Verify their email (via a verification link)
    * Log in
    * List all available uploaded files
    * Download files securely via a time-based encrypted URL, accessible only to Client Users
All download links are encrypted and access-controlled to prevent unauthorized downloads.

- Installation & Running Instructions
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-file-sharing.git
cd secure-file-sharing
2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
4️⃣ Test APIs using Postman
* Import the Postman collection from /postman/file_sharing_api.postman_collection.json
* Use the API endpoints as per the documentation above.

-Postman Collection
Postman Collection JSON file is available inside the postman/ folder:
* file_sharing_api.postman_collection.json
Import this into Postman to directly test all API routes.

-Test Cases
* Written using pytest
* To run all tests:
pytest

-Deployment Plan
In a production environment:
* Dockerize the application with a Dockerfile
* Host on Render, Railway, Fly.io, or Heroku
* Use .env files for sensitive environment variables like DB credentials and encryption keys
* Configure a real SMTP service for actual email verification
* Optionally, store files on a cloud storage service (like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage)
